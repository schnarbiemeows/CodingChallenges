	 * difficulty - MEDIUM
	 * description:
	 * Given a Circular Linked List node, which is sorted in non-descending order,
	 * write a function to insert a value insertVal into the list such that it remains a sorted circular list.
	 * The given node can be a reference to any single node in the list and may not necessarily be the
	 * smallest value in the circular list.
	 *
	 * If there are multiple suitable places for insertion, you may choose any place to insert the new value.
	 * After the insertion, the circular list should remain sorted.
	 *
	 * If the list is empty (i.e., the given node is null), you should create a new single circular list and
	 * return the reference to that single node. Otherwise, you should return the originally given node.
	 *
	 * constraints:
	 * The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 5 * 10^4]. // 5000, but could be zero
	 * -106 <= Node.val, insertVal <= 106
