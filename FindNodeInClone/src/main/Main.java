	 * Given two binary trees original and cloned and given a reference to a node target in the original tree.
	 *
	 * The cloned tree is a copy of the original tree.
	 *
	 * Return a reference to the same node in the cloned tree.
	 *
	 * Note that you are not allowed to change any of the two trees or the target node and the answer
	 * must be a reference to a node in the cloned tree.
	 * constraints:
	 * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10^4].
	 * The values of the nodes of the tree are unique.
	 * target node is a node from the original tree and is not null.
