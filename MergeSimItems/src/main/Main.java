	 * difficulty - easy
	 * description:
	 * You are given two 2D integer arrays, items1 and items2, representing two sets of items.
	 * Each array items has the following properties:
	 *
	 * items[i] = [valuei, weighti] where valuei represents the value and weighti represents the weight of the ith item.
	 * The value of each item in items is unique.
	 * Return a 2D integer array ret where ret[i] = [valuei, weighti], with weighti being the sum of weights of all items with value valuei.
	 *
	 * Note: ret should be returned in ascending order by value.
	 * constraints:
	 * 1 <= items1.length, items2.length <= 1000
	 * items1[i].length == items2[i].length == 2
	 * 1 <= valuei, weighti <= 1000
	 * Each valuei in items1 is unique.
	 * Each valuei in items2 is unique.
