Given a non negative integer number num. For every numbers i in the range 0 â‰¤ i â‰¤ num calculate the number 
of 1's in their binary representation and return them as an array.

1 = 1
2 = 1
3 = 2
4 = 1
5 = 2
6 = 2
7 = 3
8 = 1
9 = 2
10 = 2
11 = 3
12 = 2

wait a minute: 32 bits in an int
bit 1: %2 = 1
bit 
	public int[] countBits(int num) {
        
    }
