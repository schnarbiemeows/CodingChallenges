the only way you cant win the game is if there are only 4 stones left when it is your turn
since you get to go first
so if n==4 return false;
else return true
ok, so not exactly true, the answer involves assuming that the opponent is smart and will
always make the best move, so
if(n%4==0) return false else return true
