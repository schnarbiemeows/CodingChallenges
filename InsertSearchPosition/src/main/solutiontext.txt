this one seems easy, the array is sorted
so O(n) solution 
just go through the array, keeping track of the current index, until you either find the number
or the first number greater than it. Then return the index of that number

	public int searchInsert(int[] nums, int target) {
        int counter = 0;
        while(nums[counter]<target&&counter<nums.length) counter++;
        return counter;
    }
