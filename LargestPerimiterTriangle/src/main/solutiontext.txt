8,5,4,4,2,6,6,6 is the perfect test
ok, the largest length has to be < sum of the other two lengths
so you would sort
then start with the largest # and check the next two numbers
	- if largest is > then their sum, toss it and keep going
	- then we just need the highest 3 numbers
	unless k< 3
	int k = A.length-1
	while(k>1&&A[k]>A[k-1]+A[k-2]) k--;
	if k==1 return 0; else return A[k]+A[k-1]+A[k-2]
