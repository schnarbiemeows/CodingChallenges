int[] = candies
in order to do this, we would want to know how many different numbers there are
if N = total # of numbers, and X = total different #s,
if there are N/2+1 or more different numbers, then the 
girl can get N/2 different #s, otherwise, she would get X different #s
so all we have to do is sort, and everytime the current # is different than the one before it, then
X = X+1
