if the two strings were equal, then there would be no subsequence of either string that would
not be in the other
so, we gotta work the NOT of this one
1.) if one string is longer, the longer string is the answer
2.) else they two strings are the same length
wait a minute, they want the LONGEST uncommon subsequence
ha, the two strings are either the same length or they aren't
- if they are the same length and equal, then the answer is -1
- if they are the same length and not equal, the answer is the length
- if they are not the same length, the answer is the length of the longest one

the answer will always be one of these

	public int findLUSlength(String a, String b) {
        if(a==null&&b==null) return -1;
        if(a==null) return b.length();
        if(b==null) return a.length();
        if(a.equals(b)) return -1;
        if(a.length()==b.length()) return b.length();
        return a.length()>b.length() ? a.length() : b.length();
    }
